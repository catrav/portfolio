<h1>Hello!</h1>
<p><img src="me.jpg" width="111" height="222" alt="An image of myself"> My name is Carmen Travnicek. I am from Chicago, IL but have been living in Washington for 5 years. A little about me, I was raised by Mexican immigrants, I played soccer all through high school, don't drink coffee (tea kinda girl), collected comics, written stories (not shared nor published), have stacks of sketchbooks from growing up, weight lift 3-5x a week and I enjoy exploring/traveling for food/culture/history.</p>
<h3>Place to Place</h3>
<p>I have traveled to a few places. Coming to Washington, I packed my car and drove all the way from Chicago to Washington, stopping throughout to see the sites. It was amazing and reminded me of "On the Road." Moving to Washington was a bit overwhelming especially not knowing anyone but once I found somewhere to work it got better. Aside from that I have had the pleasure to visit Cancun on multiple occasion, Maui, which  was unreal and highly recommended, and Las Vegas, also a number of times.</p>
<h3>Passion</h3>
<p>I am an engineer but I wanted to go into graphic design. I have always enjoyed creating things, whether its writing a poem, sketching, its the act of expression yourself that can't be topped. So getting into webpage development is something I am very interested in because here's a platfrom I can tie in the experience as an engineer and bring my artistic side to create a platform to share various topics. From pop culture to enginnering fields, the range is limitless so I am very excited and hope others are willing to take a browse.All in all, these webpages I created/create are to create a platform to share, learn, and meet others. The world is big and it's refreshing getting different point of views by popping the bubble we inhibit. The beauty of this is also how we can connect internationally so please join me as we start this journey. If you go back to the Home Page <em>(button on top of webpage)</em>, you will have the option to select through various topics.</p>
